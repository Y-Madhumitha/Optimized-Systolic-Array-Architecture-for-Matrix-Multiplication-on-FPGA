## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. *Input Formatting:* Matrices are encoded in a compact hexadecimal format to reduce I/O and memory access time.
2. *Systolic Array Design:* Multiple processing elements (PEs) compute partial products in a pipelined and synchronized fashion.
3. *Pipelining:* Enables overlapping of operations for throughput maximization.
4. *Deployment:* Fully synthesized and tested on a physical FPGA board for real-time performance validation.
